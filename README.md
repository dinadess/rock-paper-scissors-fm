## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

I had the opportunity to practice the JS language I'm currently learning:

- to think of the problems before starting coding, to have a global view of the variables I'll need (Actually,
  I didn't do this the first time ðŸ˜…, I had to delete almost all the code I wrote and rewrite it all)
- refactor code into functions according to the DRY principle
- debug as some things didn't work out properly, I use loads of (console.log()) to figure them out.

Here are some code lines I'm proud of:

```css
.icon::after {
  content: "";
  display: inline-block;
  width: 135%;
  height: 135%;
  border-radius: 50%;
  position: absolute;
  z-index: -1;
  box-shadow: inset 0px -10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
}
```

I'm quite proud of this one as I didn't know how to create the colored circles around the icons and make
them look like coins with the inner shadow.
After some mistakes, I got this solution...

```js
console.log(
  `I am proud of every single line of js code I wrote cause at the beginning I thought it would be a very big challenge but finally I nailed it!`
);
```

### Continued development

I will keep learning js to improve my coding style and write more DRY code.

### Useful resources

- [The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert! by Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) - This is the JS course I'm currently learning, it helped me a lot to understand how JS works and to be solution-oriented.
